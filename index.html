    I am a big NERD and I have decided to build a website completely from scratch using Github, HTML, and 
    Jekyll. I never took a website development class, so I am teaching myself! I <a href="burble.html"
    style="color:black; text-decoration: none;">believe</a> that you can do anything
    you set your mind to, but learning takes time, so bear with me. This website is <i>under construction</i> for
    now, but keep checking back in to see it improve!
