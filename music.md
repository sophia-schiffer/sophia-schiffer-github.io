# Music Stuff
Yay, you’re checking out the music stuff! Music is my first love and lifetime passion. I am a Chicago-based violinist and composer. Most of my compositions use a soulful, cinematic style and tend to feature the string orchestra. One of my pieces was premiered by Interlake High School’s nationally award-winning chamber orchestra. To watch that performance, click on the video below this bio! You’ll also see me leading the viola section (yes, I had to take one for the team). I grew up playing violin and I have done practically everything under the sun with the instrument from performing classical violin concertos to stealing the talent show with The Devil Went Down to Georgia on my blue electric violin. Today, I am mostly focussed on accompanying church services and musical theater performances on violin and viola. I am a weekly violinist at Saint Clement Parish in Chicago.
