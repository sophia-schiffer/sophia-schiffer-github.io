    <h1 style="color:palevioletred; text-align: center;">About Me</h1>
<p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', serif; font-size: 22px; margin: 25px 200px 75px; line-height: 1.5;">
    I am a recent mechanical engineering graduate of Northwestern University, currently 
    working as a Guest Engagement Facilitator at the Griffin Museum of Science and Industry 
    (MSI). That’s just a fancy way of saying that I am an informal educator who gives demos 
    and tours at MSI while wearing a vibrant orange lab coat for the purpose of “inspiring 
    the inventive genius in everyone”. I strongly believe in the mission of MSI. As an 
    intelligent person who often struggled with, and was discouraged by, traditional education, 
    I have made it my purpose to find creative solutions to help our world’s brightest minds 
    reach their full potential. For me, this means supporting all students, especially those 
    facing “learning disabilities”, in growing their personal strengths and building up their 
    self-confidence. As a personal project, I am passionate about motivational journaling 
    and studying the mind to help myself and others find peace, fulfillment, and happiness 
    in their daily lives. I am currently involved in a year-long “gap” project called <i>Building 
        a Life in 365 Days</i>, where I explore ways in which I can fulfill my personal and 
        professional goals in a new goal-oriented lifestyle. I am also an avid musician, excited 
        about continuing my musical endeavors as I stay in Chicago. I hope that my website will 
        help you, whoever you may be, gain a holistic perspective of me, maybe provide some 
        entertainment, and serve as a hub for sharing my fun spread of all that makes me who I am.
