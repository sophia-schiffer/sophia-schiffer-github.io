    <h1 style="color:palevioletred; text-align: center;">About Me</h1>
<p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', serif; font-size: 22px; margin: 25px 200px 75px;">
    I am a Northwestern University engineering student and an avid musician. As a personal project, I am passionate about motivational journaling
    and studying the mind to help myself and others find peace, fulfillment, and happiness in their daily lives. This is why I
    created my personal website. In high school I randomly picked up a poster from a UPenn recruiting event that read in
    massive letters, <i>"Don't be defined by just one thing."</i> I kept this poster in my childhood bedroom throughout my
    senior year, and it has stayed there since. I firmly believe that this philosophy can lead to increased
    fulfillment and stimulation in all areas of one's life, which is why I have chosen to explore my college 
    journey this way. As I search for my next job or institution for further study, I hope that my website will help
    those reviewing my qualifications to gain a holistic perspective,
    along with serving as a hub for sharing my fun spread of all that makes me who I am.
