    <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>I am a Chicago-based mechanical engineer and violinist. I grew up with an endless curiosity about the world around me. I was inspired by the way that math and science helped me understand this world. My fascination with numbers and puzzles drove me to study mechanical engineering and robotics at Northwestern University. I am currently employed as a mechanical engineer on the custom design team at Focal Point, LLC. This exciting endeavor has me combining all that stuff I learned in school with my naturally artistic tendencies to bring quality lighting solutions to a wide spectrum of people (like you!).</p>

<p>Being a born and bred Pacific Northwesterner, I never shy away from adventure. My post-graduation year from undergrad has been full of opportunities and surprises. Immediately following my graduation in June of 2024, I worked as a tour guide at the friggin’ MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY! I strongly believe in the museum’s mission to “inspire the inventive genius in everyone”. As an intelligent person who often struggled with, and was discouraged by, traditional education, I have made it my purpose to find creative solutions to help our world’s brightest minds reach their full potential. I am excited to continue educating and mentoring at my new company when opportunities arise!</p>

<p>As a personal project, I am passionate about motivational journaling and studying the mind to help myself and others find peace, fulfillment, and happiness in their daily lives. I am currently involved in a year-long podcast project called <em>Building a Life in 365 Days</em>, where I explore ways in which I can fulfill my personal and professional goals in a new goal-oriented lifestyle. My side career as an avid musician has kept me on my toes, providing an interesting lens to get to know Chicago. I hope that my website will help you, whoever you may be, gain a holistic perspective of me, maybe provide some entertainment, and serve as a hub for sharing my fun spread of all that makes me who I am.</p>

<p>Okay, but enough about me. I want to know about you! <a href="contact.html" style="text-decoration: none; color:magenta;"> Let’s chat! </a></p>
