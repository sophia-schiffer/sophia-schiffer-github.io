## Sweatshirt Project
I was once in a store when I saw the perfect Sweatshirt - a light pink crewneck
that simply said "Sweatshirt" on it. Or so I thought. Upon closer inspection, I
noticed that this sweatshirt actually said "Sweetheart" on it. My shopping trip
ruined, I was inspired to design the perfect sweatshirt myself. If I can get
at least 30 people in the Chicago area to get behind this design and purchase
one, my tragedy will come to an end and I shall live happily ever after!
